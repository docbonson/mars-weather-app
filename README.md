# Mars Weather App
This project is a React-based Mars Weather App that provides weather information for specific sols (Martian days). Due to changes in the NASA API, which is no longer providing the required weather data, a temporary solution involves hardcoding sample data for demonstration purposes.

# Project Overview
This React app utilizes Create React App for project bootstrapping. It offers features to display the latest weather data on Mars, including temperature, wind speed, and direction.
